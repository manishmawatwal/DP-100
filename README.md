### You are planning to host practical training to acquaint staff with Docker for Windows. Staff devices must support the installation of Docker. What are the minimum Docker Requirements?
1.	4 GB of system RAM
2.	BIOS-enabled virtualization
3.	Windows 10 64-bit

### .......... is required for a Deep Learning Virtual Machine (DLVM) to support Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) computations.
> GPU

### You need to implement a Data Science Virtual Machine (DVSM) that supports the Caffe2 Deep Learning (DL) framework. Which OS supports Caffe2 deep learning framework?
> Ubuntu 16.04

### You have been tasked with employing a Machine Learning (ML) model, which makes use of a PostgreSQL database and needs GPU processing, to forecast prices. You are preparing to create a VM that has the necessary tools built into it.
1. Geo AI Data Science Virtual Machine (Geo-DSVM) Windows edition *cannot* be used for forecasting prices.
2. Deep Learning Virtual Machine (DLVM) Windows edition *can* be used for forecasting prices.
3. Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) Windows edition *cannot* be used to forecasting prices.

### To move data into Azure Blob Storage for the purpose of supporting Azure ML, you can utilise which modules?
1.	AzCopy
2.	SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)
3.	Azure Storage Explorer

### To move a large dataset from Azure ML Studio to a Weka environment, the data must be converted to the .......... format.
> ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format)

### You have been tasked with designing a DL model, which accommodates the most recent edition of python, to recognize language. Which is the suitable framework for designing a DL model in the DSVM?
> TensorFlow

### You have been tasked with evaluating your model on a partial data sample via k-fold cross-validation. You have already configured a k-parameter as the number of splits. You now have to configure the k parameter for the cross-validation with the usual value choice.
Recommendation: You configure the use of the value k=3
> The requirements *will not* be satisfied.
Recommendation: You configure the use of the value k=10
> The requirements *will* be satisfied.

### .......... can split date into two separate datasets while constructing a ML experiment via Azure ML Studio.
Split Data Module

### You have been tasked with creating a new Azure pipeline via the ML designer. You have to make sure that the pipeline trains a model using data in a comma-separated values (CSV) file that is published on a website. A dataset for the file does not exist. .......... can be used to ingest data from the CSV file into the designer pipeline with the least amount of administrative effort?
> Import Data object to the pipeline
